		<u><b><h2>Computers are Stupid</h2></b></u>
		"Each of us saw her duck." Does that mean each of us saw her pet duck? Or did we each see her duck under something? Depending on the context, you might be able to infer which interpretation is correct.<br>
		<b>Computers can't make these inferences and so they interpret language literally.</b>
			<em>Keep this in mind when programming</em>
